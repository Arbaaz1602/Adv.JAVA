----------------Servlet part 2---------------
When GET request is made to the servlet.
The servlet recieves the HTTP GET request if it is accessed:
1.By typing the url in the browser's address bar.
2.Using html's anchor tang <a href="hello">Click Here</a>
3.Using html form without 'method' attribute.

The servlet recieves http post request if it is accessed using html form with 'method=post'

COLLABORATION
when two componenets of same web application are interacting with each other, that process is kniwn as collaboration.

One Servlet can become a client of another servlet,

RequestDispatcher(I)--> Used to achieve collaboration between the components running within the same web application.	
-----------------
Collaboration is handled using javax.servle.RequestDispatcher
The componenet which want to collaborate needs to obtain the referance of type RequestDispatcher 
for the component which is the target	

How to obtain RequestDispatcher:
A request Dispatcher is obtaained using javax.servlet.ServletRequest
It provides a mothod 
RequestDispatcher getRequestDipatcher(String targetURL);

How to use RequestDispatcher. 
This is used by calling one of the two methods:
forward(ServletRequest, ServletResponse)
-Forwards a request to the target and generates a response back tothe client
include(ServletRequest, ServetResponse)	
-forwards the request to the target, takes the reponse from the target comes back to the sourceand the source generates response 
back to the client.

Session Management:
Activity to maintain the state along with the client
In a web application an end user can make some transaction through one or multiple requests
During this server needs to maintain a conversational state along with the client.
This technique is known as session tracking.

methods of session tracking:
-URL tracking
-Hidden fields
-cookies
-Servlet API - HttpSession

HttpSession(I)---------->javax.servlet.http;
For every user httpSession maintains a state.

*In orderto manage state it is necessary to manage an object of type javax.servlet.http.httpSession;
HttpSession is obtained using httpServletRequest;
provides two methods:
HttpSession getSession()------>Returns an existing session if available Otherwise creates a new one and returns same
HttpSession getSession(boolean)--------> Behaves same as that of getSession() if true is passed.
                                         If false is passed returns a session only if available.
                                         If not available does not create a new session. returns null;
                                         
----------------------------------------
JSP------>JAVA SERVER PAGES
Server side component that is used to extend functionality of web server.
Used to generate dynamic web content
All the things which is done by JSP same can be done using servlet and vice versa.

Logic in web application:
Processing logic
Presentation logic

Why JSP
-Allows developers to concentrate on presentation rather than processing.
-Designer without knowing java still can develop eligant web pages

For first ever request jsp gets loaded by web container. 
jsp gets translated into servlet by web container
(JSP is an abstraction over Servlet)
The time at which translation happens is known as translation time which is recorded by web container in a saperate object.
That object is known as timestamp
web container invokes jspinit()
web container invokes _service()
from 2nd request onwards---> only _service()
if server is stopped or undeloped then jspDestroy()

Life cycle methods for jsp:
jspinit()
_jspService()
jspDestroy()

What can be written inside a jsp page?
-All html tags
-Any valid java code
-JSP tags

JSP tags types
-Directives
-Scripting Elements
-Standard Action

_directives------------->denoted by <%@............%>
1.page- Used to specify some information about page
<%@page attr="value"....%>
-language-->specifies scripting language of jsp page.
-extends
-import
-session
-isTreadSafe
-errorPage
-isErrorPage

2.include------------>used to include resources like html,jspor text files.
3.taglib

Scripting elements
-Declaration-->used to declare variables and define methods
-Scriplet--> used to write any valid java code. 
-Expression
