Form processing using Spring MVC
When processing a formthe request specific parameter values need to be captured inside some variables. 
Therefore the request handling method must not have empty signature.it must be parameterized.

In form processing the request parameter names need to be mapped with signature of  names in request handling method.
This can be done using RequestParam annotation which is to be applied at the parameter level within the method signature  

If request parameter names are same as that of variable names of request handing method signature @RequestParam can be omitted

HTTP Request has saveral types 
-GET
-POST
-PUT
-DELETE

To configure the request handling method there is a better alternative which clearly tells what type of httpRequest the method is going to handle.
It is simplified using ralevent annotations.
@GetMapping
@PostMappng
@PutMapping
@DeleteMapping

eg. @RequestMapping(value=/validate" , method = RequestMethod.POST)
is equivalent of @PostMapping("/validate")
@GetMapping("/indexPage")

REST: Representational State Transfer

Web Service: A web service is a service that is accessed via Web that involves machine to machine exchange of information irrespective of the platform and the technology.
In web service standards data is exchanged between two applications using some standard format (XML)
Since XML follows a text format in a structured way and text format is universally accepted by all OS it brings interoperability.
Web services are of two types:
1.SOAP based
SOAP ---> SIMPLE OBJECT ACCESS PROTOCOL
Resources are accessed using http sementics and data is exchanged using xml.
The entire communication happens through xml over http.
SOAP = XML + HTTP

2.Restful
Its purely based upon http
REST resources are accessed using HTTP but the response can be sent using the format which best suits the consumer.
Typically in restful services the format is JSON.
JSON--->JavaScript Object Notation

Rest resources can be respresented in any form including JSON and XML
Rest client--> Any program that makes request to rest API is rest client.


REST implementation:
1. Spring MVC framework: suitable for combining monolithic and micro services

2.Spring Boot frameork
Most useful for building restful services.
Provides mechanism to bootstrap the application with minimum efforts

Building REST API using Spring Boot
There are 3 options:
1. Using Spring Boot Starter plugins available with some special IDE: Spring tool Suite
2. Using CLI: Command Line Iterface
3. Using Spring web initializer
	start.spring.io

@SpringBootApplication------> Annotation used in spring boot that combines 3 annotations
1.@configuration
2.@ComponentScan
3.@EnableAutoConfiguration

Changing the default port
In spring boot application the application specific configurations settings are done inside properties file. application.properties

To change the port number use server.port
Create REST endpoints
To create rest Endpoints, create REST implementation class
This must be annotated with @RestController so that it is considered as REST implementation class

Add an endpoint using some method that handles httpRequest
In Rest the returned value is not a view name rather it is a data.

JSON Format:
{
  "restrauntId":"R01",
}

The conversion between java and jason or vice versa is done using an API knownas JAckson API. 

To capture the value available in the path variable @PathVariable annotation is used.
It is applied at the parameter level

A rest Api can also be be tested using a tool postman.
